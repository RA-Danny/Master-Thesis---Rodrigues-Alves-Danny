\chapter{CRM AI: An use case} \label{chapter:use-case}

One of the goals of this project is to integrate an artificial intelligence solution within a CRM. After the analysis of \textit{CRM AI}, it has been decided to develop a predictive machine learning model based on CRM data. This part has been developed in collaboration with one of ELCA's client, hereafter referenced as \textit{Company A} \footnote{Client name and business subject to confidentiality.}.

This chapter \ref{chapter:use-case} details this machine learning project. Sections \ref{sec:use-case} and \ref{sec:ml-metrics} explains the problem \textit{Company A} is currently facing and how a machine learning solution might solve it.The data to feed the machine learning comed from Company A's CRM, as explained in section \ref{sec:crm-data}. Section \ref{sec:ml-experimentation} details the machine learning experimentation and models used. Once the model has been trained and tested, it was integrate within Company A's CRM, as outlined in section \ref{sec:crm-deployment}. Finally, sections \ref{sec:use-case-further-work} and \ref{sec:use-case-conclusion} conclude this part with a reflection on the entire initiative.

\section{Client's use case} \label{sec:use-case}
\textit{Company A} is a global energy enterprise active overall Switzerland. It offers several products and services and one of those is subject to a very tense market, where the characteristics of the product are the same for all companies and the price is the only difference between competitors. Therefore, several specificity of this product must be taken into account:
\begin{itemize}
\item This product is classified as a safety need in Maslow's hierarchy of needs\cite{wiki:Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs}, meaning that people don't buy it because the \textit{like} it but rather because they \textit{need} it. 
\item Due to its classification in Marslow's hierarchy, the product is usually stored in high quantities. Typical customer will make a large order, fill their supplies and once fully consumed, buy back the product, again in large quantities. Therefore, the product is not buy on a daily basis, more on an annual-basis. This complicates the job of Company A to build customer loyalty.
\item As product's characteristics are the same for all, the price is the only variable that companies can \textit{play} with. Nevertheless, a part of the price is subject to market variation, from which companies will adapt their margins. As all stock market, the prices can vary, even marginally, each day.
\end{itemize}

 Based on these particularities of the product, building a solid customer relationship is difficult for \textit{Company A}. Customers only need to make one order per year and their are usually not subject to an immediate need. Therefore, they can take the time to compare the price offered by all suppliers in the market and place an order accordingly. This facts explain why \textit{Company A} is often dealing with \textit{one-time customers} and experiences a high customer turnover \textbf{[ADD DATA SUPPORING THAT CLAIM]}.
 
 
 To counter this customer churn, \textit{Company A} is building \textit{customer recovery} plans to get back lost clients as well as interactions with other products and services to build an ecosystem of offers, but they want something uniquely targeting their key-product. Currently, Company A marketing team are contacting clients with annual newsletters. Those newsletters are send to each client every year around the same period. The company wants to strengthen this marketing process by contacting clients at the perfect time, before they start to search for offers from the competition. This will enable Company A to retain clients and ultimately build customer loyalty.

\section{Formalize machine learning problem} \label{sec:ml-metrics}

As defined in section \ref{sec:use-case}, the goal of this initiative is to build a machine learning model that predicts the time of a customer's next order. This problem can be formalize as a regression problem, for which the machine learning model will output the date of next order: at date $d$, the model will predict $i$, the number of days until next order. So $d+i$ will give the precise data of customer next order. Variants are to define $i$ as the number of weeks or months until next order. The date will be less precise but the predictions might turn out to be more satisfying. Another possibility is to formalize it as a classification task and output a binary value to the question : \textit{"Will this customer make an order in the coming day/week/month ?"}. After discussion with \textit{Company A}, it has been decided to define the output of the model as \textit{the number of months until customer next order}. In details, it has been decided first to work with regression models to have multiple ranges of outputs. Then, for the output's granularity (day, week or month), predicting the number of month until next order \textit{should} give stronger results. It will allow \textit{Company A} to asses how well a regression techniques are suited for this problem and, in a second phase, trying to have more precise predictions, with an output at the week level for example.

From the machine learning output, Company A wants to reach customers before they make an order. The process is planned as follow:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item At the beginning of each month, compute the predictions for all active clients\footnote{An client is flagged as inactive if no more business can be made with him/her (moving abroad or death for example)}.
    \item Retrieve all clients with a predictions smaller than $2$.
    \item Get in touch with these clients if and only if they have not been contacted in the past two months.
\end{enumerate}
The last step of this process is very important, as it will ensure that the company won't reach the same client twice.


Now that the machine learning goal and usage have been specified, the metrics for its success must be defined. As stated above, this is a regression model, where the output will be a real number. Usual metrics for regression problems like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are not well suited for this project and for the usage of the predictions by \textit{Company A}. As specified above, the company plans to get in touch with a client only if the predictions is below $2$. Therefore, if the output of a model is equal to $7.0$ months or $4.35$, it ends up being the same for \textit{Company A}. This explains why RMSE or MAE cannot be used to evaluate machine learning models performance. As regression metrics are not applicable, the models will be assess with custom metrics inspired by classification problems: precision, recall and F1 score. 

To transform the regression problem into a classification one, model's predictions will be classify into one of the following four classes: \texttt{0, 1, 2 or 3+}. The class \texttt{0} is meant for predictions between 0 and 1 (excluded) - clients that should make an order in the current month. Same idea for classes \texttt{1} and \texttt{2}. The class \texttt{3+} regroups all predictions with an output bigger or equal to 3 - client next order should occur in three or more months.

Based on this classes assignment, a confusion matrix can be generated. Then, custom metrics inspired by precision, recall and F1-score are computed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Precision}: Of all clients that make an order in the current month, how many where predicted with class 0 or 1? This metric computes the percentage of true orders catch by the model. 
    $$ Precision = \frac{t_0\_p_0 + t_0\_p_1}{t_0\_p_0 + t_0\_p_1 + t_0\_p_2 + t_0\_p_{3+}} $$
    
    For the example in table 3.2, the precision is equal to $\frac{2+0}{2+0+1+0} = 0.667$
    
    \item \textbf{Recall}: From all clients that the model has predicted an order for the current month, how many did actually made an order in the current or coming month? The goal with this metric is to assert that the model is not always predicting 0, which will give a precision score of 100\%, but will make \textit{Company A} contact all clients. 
    $$ Recall = \frac{t_0\_p_0 + t_1\_p_0}{t_0\_p_0 + t_1\_p_0 + t_2\_p_0 + t_{3+}\_p_0} $$
    
    For the example in table 3.2, the recall is equal to $\frac{2+1}{2+1+0+1} = 0.75$
    
    \item \textbf{F1-score}: Same as the F1-score for classification tasks. 
    $$ \fscore = \frac{2*Precision*Recall}{Precision+Recall} $$

    For the example in table 3.2, the F1-score is equal to $\frac{2*0.667*0.75}{0.667+0.75} = 0.71$
\end{itemize}

In the formulas above, $t_i\_p_j$ correspond to the sum of true orders occurring in \texttt{i} months and predicted to occur in \texttt{j} months. For example $t_0\_p_0$ corresponds to the count of orders occurring in the current month and predicted as such (top left case in the confusion matrix).

The metric \textbf{F1-score} will be the benchmark metric for this project.

\section{Data from CRM} \label{sec:crm-data}

Now that the machine learning parameters have been detailed, the data to be used with the model is specified. This section outlines the data gathering, cleaning, transformation and feature engineering. Before doing some machine learning experiments, a first goal is to understand the data and figure out the main factors that push a client to make an order. For the analysis of data and machine learning experiments, the development has been done within \textit{Jupyter Notebooks} with a \texttt{Python 3} kernel, mainly relying on the \textit{Pandas} package.

Data comes from \textit{Company A}'s CRM, a Dynamics 365 Online system. Thanks to the Web Api offered by Dynamics 365, all entities of the CRM have been retrieved and analyzed.

From the 291 entities present in Company A's CRM, only a few are useful for this project: \texttt{Orders}, \texttt{Accounts}, \texttt{Contacts} and \texttt{Buildings}. The relations between those entities are straightforward: An order must be linked to an account and each account is linked to at least one contact, the \textit{primary contact}. The \texttt{Contact} entity models a real person, where the \texttt{Account} entity models a customer of \textit{Company A}, either a private person or a company. Contacts can then be linked to one or more instance of the \texttt{Building} entity.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{images/entityDiagram.png}
    \caption{Entity Diagram for \textit{Company A} CRM data - \textbf{TODO}}
    \label{fig:entity-diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Orders}\label{sec:crm-orders}

The \texttt{Order} entity holds all information linked to an order made by one account. The CRM contains all orders received by \textit{Company A} since 2013 and for this project the most recent data concern June 2018. Once the raw data has been download from all \texttt{Orders} entities, the first step is to clean this set of 808'532 orders. Even if Dynamics 365 has some restriction on data entry, mistakes can still happen when a person enters data into the system. Therefore, the orders dataset was first reduced, by discarding orders with an empty name, orders cancelled, orders containing mistakes in the internal parameters (amount delivered equal to zero, delivery date in 1956, delivery date occurring before the order date, ..). This cleaning phase removes 28.79\% of the data which gives a data set of 575'679 orders, each order having 37 features.

All these orders have been made by 183'706 accounts, with a mean of 3.40 orders per account, but a median of 2. As showed by figure \ref{fig:orders-account-counts}, 50.77\% of accounts is this dataset have made 1 or 2 orders\footnote{Accounts which have made at least one order from 2013.}. This demonstrates the particularity of the market, in which clients are not \textit{loyal} to a given company, but often \textit{try} the competition. For the orders made by those infrequent accounts, it will be very difficult to extract common behavior from it and it might end up adding noise to the model. Therefore, they have been discarded from the final data set. Removing all orders made by an account with less that three orders output a data set of 451'966 orders (-21.49\%).

As accounts only make one order per year, there is a seasonality effect (figure XXX). Even if the cyclicity of orders isn't regular thought the year, there is some facts that we can extract: There is usually two pics: the first around Mars and the second around October. On the opposite side, there is less orders coming in Spring. From those facts and the kind of regular cycles extracted, it has been decided that the Weather should be taken into account by the model. Usage of the weather data is detailed in section \ref{sec:external-data}.


As stated above, the numbers of months between two orders for the typical customer is 
As stated above, a typical customer will make an order once per year, with a number of months between two orders around 12 months. This claim is supported by the CRM data in figure XXX. Nevertheless, it's interesting to see that the mean is around 12 months between two consecutive orders, but the median is equal to 11 months. Figure XX clearly shows that there are a lot of orders coming 11 months after the previous one, but there is also a lot coming sooner. On the other hand, there is a lot less orders occurring at least 13 months after the previous.
The plot in figure XXX also shows that there is a majority of orders occurring in the same month as the previous one. This is explained by Company A key-accounts. Those accounts are companies which need to be delivered on a weekly basis. As detailed in section \ref{sec:data-shape-for-ml}, this will not be a problem for the machine learning model.
 \textbf{---> Redo the paragraph above but with the time between order per account, not per orders. Also add the segmentation as shown in slide 18.}

\end{figure}

Features presend in the order dataset: Amount of delivery, datum, product, channel of order and account GUID.


\subsection{Accounts, Clients and Buildings}\label{sec:crm-accounts}
The \texttt{Account} entity holds information related to the clients of \textit{Company A}, either a natural or legal person. Due to imports from a legacy system, the Dynamics 365 instance of \textit{Company A} contains more than 1'100'000 accounts. Filter those accounts based on the final orders from section \ref{sec:crm-orders} gives 88'552 accounts, with 244 features per account. The company stocks a lot of account properties in their CRM, mainly for legal reasons, and the vast majority of those being null. After a review of all these features, only 11 of them will be kept, as the information if the account is active or not, or the account's name, which will be compared it's primary client name.

Indeed, all accounts are linked to a primary contact. The \texttt{Contact} entity holds information about a physical person, like its address or phone number. From this entity, only two features will be used: the birth date and the name. The birth date will be used to see if the age of a person as an influence on it's buying habits. The contact name will be compared to the account name. As mentioned above, the Account entity can be either a natural or a legal person, but there is no feature in the CRM to distinguish those two types of accounts. Nevertheless, this information is important, as a legal person can make orders on a very frequent basis. To build this feature, an account's name will be compared to the name of its primary contact. The assumption is that an account modelling a natural person will have the same name as the primary contact, but the name of a legal person is not the same as the primary contact. \textbf{TODO: Add chart showing that it works (Inspired by slide 19 \#2).}

Concerning the \texttt{Building} entity, it holds information about the building (house, offices, cottage,...) of a contact. Even if not all contacts have such link \textbf{TODO: Add data}, this entity will be used to build new features modeling the amount of product stocked and used trought the time, as detailed in section \ref{sec:ml-features}.
