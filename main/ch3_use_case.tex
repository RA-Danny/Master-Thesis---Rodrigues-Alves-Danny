\chapter{CRM AI: An use case}

One of the goals of this project is to integrate an artificial intelligence solution within a CRM. After the analysis of \textit{CRM AI}, it has been decided to develop a predictive machine learning model based on CRM data. This part has been developed in collaboration with one of ELCA's client, hereafter referenced as \textit{Company A} \footnote{ELCA's client name and business subject to confidentiality.}.

\section{Client's use case}
ELCA's client \textit{Company A} is present in the entire Swiss market, offering several products and services. One of the product is subject to a very tense market, where product's characteristics are the same among all competitors, with only the price as differentiate. This product is classified as a safety need in Maslow's hierarchy of needs\cite{wiki:Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs}, meaning that people don't buy it because the \textit{like} it but rather because they \textit{need} it.
