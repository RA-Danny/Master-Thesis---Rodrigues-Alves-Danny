In recent years, CRM's editors have gain interest in investigating artificial intelligence solutions. To create a strong relationship with their clients, companies need to personalize their offers and processes. This customization of offers is supported by customer relationship management (CRM) systems holding all company's knowledge about its customers. With the advent of artificial intelligence, the large amounts of data stored in an CRM can be used by companies to adopt a real customer-centric strategy.

This study makes an overview of the artificial intelligence solutions powered by CRM's editors. The goal is to understand the uses of these solutions, their incorporation into business processes, the types of artificial intelligence techniques used as well as the efforts and implications required to integrate them. The results indicate that all major CRM players have and are investing heavily in this market, but some have take the lead with more features offered. Connections and integrations with other solutions are proving to be very important to have intelligent CRM systems.

A proof-of-concept is developed to demonstrate how a machine learning project can be created from CRM data and integrated directly into business processes. Based on a fully connected neural network, the model predicts the date of customers next order in a very competitive market. The predictions enable a company to plan the future and understand client's needs before they occur.
