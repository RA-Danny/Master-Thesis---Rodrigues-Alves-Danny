With the advent of artificial intelligence combined to high amounts of data, more and more companies adopt a customer-centric strategy. To create a strong relationship with their clients, companies need to personalize their offers and process for each customer. This customization of offers is supported by customer relationship management systems holding all company's knowledge about its customers.

This study contains an overview of the artificial intelligence solutions powered by CRM's editors. The aim is to understand the uses of these solutions, their incorporation into business processes, the efforts and implications required to integrate them, and the type of artificial intelligence techniques used. The result of this study indicates that all major players have invested heavily in this market, but that one of them currently has a significant lead. Connections and integrations with other solutions are proving to be very important to have intelligent CRM systems.

A proof-of-concept is developed to demonstrated how machine learning projects can be created from CRM data and integrated directly into business processes. Based on a fully connected neural network, the model predicts the date of customers next order in a very competitive market.
