I would first like to thank the company who offered me the possibility of deepening a very interesting subject. I would also like to thank ELCA's client for agreeing to be involved in this project, for giving me access to their data, for taking the time to explain the challenges of their business and for being available throughout my thesis.

My gratitude also to the entire CRM's division at ELCA and especially to Pierre-Olivier Pujol, Benoît Emmonet and Dilip Menon for their availability, recommendations, remarks, and interest thought the project.

I would also like to thank Jérémie Rappaz for his supervision, time, and advice.
