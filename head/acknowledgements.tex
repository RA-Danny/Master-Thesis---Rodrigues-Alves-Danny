I would first like to thank ELCA who offered me the possibility of deepening a very interesting subject. I would also like to thank ELCA's client for agreeing to be involved in this project, for giving me access to their data, for taking the time to explain the challenges of their business and for being available throughout my thesis.

My gratitude also goes to the entire CRM's division at ELCA and especially to Benoît Emonet and Pierre-Olivier Pujol for their recommendations, remarks, and interest thought the project. Thanks also to Dilip Menon for his availability and trust.
